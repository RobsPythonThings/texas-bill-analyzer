## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: External Service Fails
**Symptoms:** Agent says "couldn't complete action"

2. App is running? (check `heroku ps`)
3. Named Credential configured?

**Fix:** Update schema with correct URL, restart app

---

### Issue: Slow First Response
**Symptoms:** Takes 30+ seconds

**Expected:** This is normal for first request!
- Fetching PDF: ~2 seconds
- Claude AI analysis: ~10 seconds
- Fiscal note processing: ~3 seconds

**Second request should be fast (~2s)**

---

### Issue: Cache Not Working
**Symptoms:** Every request is slow

**Check:** Redis addon provisioned?
```bash
heroku addons --app your-app-name
```

**Fix:** Add Redis if missing:
```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:mini
```

---

### Issue: Worker Dyno Not Running
**Symptoms:** Background jobs failing

**Check:**
```bash
heroku ps --app your-app-name
```

**Fix:**
```bash
heroku ps:scale worker=1 --app your-app-name
```

---

## üí∞ Cost Verification

**Monthly Costs:**
- Eco Web Dyno: $5
- Eco Worker Dyno: $5
- Redis Mini: $3
- Heroku Managed Inference: $15-40 (usage-based)

**Total: $28-55/month**

**Check Current Usage:**
